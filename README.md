Welcome to the EONET event searching and mapping tool.
This can be viewed at http://wayward710.github.io/indy2016


This application was developed for the 2016 NASA Space Apps Challenge in Indianapolis, IN.
You can generate a map by selecting a base layer of your choice, using the checkboxes to
set preferences, and then searching for EONET events by category and date. If you click on an
event, the name and date/time of the event should appear in the top right hand corner.
